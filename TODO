* applyForJob (ATS, JREQ)

* JobFilter:

Classes:

	SearchByDate
	SearchByJob
	SearchByDateAndJob

JobApplicationList.byDate(date);
JobApplicationList.byEmployer(employer);
JobApplicationList.byDateAndEmployer(date, employer);

---

// 1) Add fields to each of the models (for better reporting)
// 2) Add filtering, grouping, sorting functionality (under the "reporting" package)
// 3) Review all the guidelines (any broken? probably few here and there)


// Report must have:
// * Date, Employer, Title, JobSeeker name
// Right now, we have "Title" and "Date", we need: Employer and JobSeeker names

Done!

JobApplicationRowAdapter

-> Looks messy (too many "getters")

Can we overwrite "set" in Backbone.Model? I think so.

Done
[x] Added extra fields to the Object Models for the reporting (no issues with circular dependencies in Backbone)
[x] All classes have no more than two instance properties
[x] Refactored so that there's a single dot per line (tabular-adapter.js)
