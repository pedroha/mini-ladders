* applyForJob (ATS, JREQ)

* JobFilter:

Classes:

	SearchByDate
	SearchByJob
	SearchByDateAndJob

JobApplicationList.byDate(date);
JobApplicationList.byEmployer(employer);
JobApplicationList.byDateAndEmployer(date, employer);

// 1) Add fields to each of the models (for better reporting)
// 2) Add filtering, grouping, sorting functionality (under the "reporting" package)
// 3) Review all the guidelines (any broken? probably few here and there)


// Report must have:
// * Date, Employer, Title, JobSeeker name
// Right now, we have "Title" and "Date", we need: Employer and JobSeeker names

Done!

JobApplicationRowAdapter

-> Looks messy (too many "getters")

Can we overwrite "set" in Backbone.Model? I think so.

Done
[x] Added extra fields to the Object Models for the reporting (no issues with circular dependencies in Backbone)
[x] All classes have no more than two instance properties
[x] Refactored so that there's a single dot per line (tabular-adapter.js)


Need to change:

JobList -> PostedJobs collection that contains a JobList?

Experimenting with PostedJobs (instead of the generic JobList).

May need to review all the collections!


// We need the same Filtering algorithms for: Employer and for the Ladders!

a) Focus on getting the Employer Filter first
b) Then create the JobSystem (/the Ladders) and do more reporting


1) Fix the DateModel <- JobApplicationDate for the JobApplication class
2) Add filtering
